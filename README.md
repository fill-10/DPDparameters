# DPDparameters
Use findparameters.py.

Change Input_Filelist.xlsx to include the pairs.

Dependencies: python >=2.7, pandas >= 0.13.1, scipy >= 0.13.3, matplotlib>=2.0.2

Exisiting problems:

Current version does not support multiple files at one distance.

Need to manually change the rc value in bd_pair.py (will be fixed soon...hopefully)

See bd_pair.py if you need to run this package on a remote machine.
